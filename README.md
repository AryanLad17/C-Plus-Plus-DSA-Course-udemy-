# C++ Data Structures & Algorithms Course

This repository contains all the C++ code I wrote while completing the Udemy Data Structures & Algorithms course.

## Folder Structure
- `Arrays/` → Array problems and solutions
- `LinkedLists/` → Singly, Doubly, Circular Linked List implementations
- `Stacks/` → Stack problems using arrays and linked lists
- `Queues/` → Queue implementations
- `Trees/` → Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Traversals
- `Graphs/` → BFS, DFS, adjacency lists/matrix
- `DynamicProgramming/` → Knapsack, LCS, Kadane, etc.
- `Backtracking/` → N-Queens, Permutations, Sudoku, etc.

## How to use
- Each folder contains `.cpp` files
- Open in any C++ IDE (like Code::Blocks, VS Code, or CLion)
- Compile and run each program individually

## Notes
- All code is written for learning purposes
- Solutions follow standard algorithms taught in the course
